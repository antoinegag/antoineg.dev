## What is Sara?
Sara is a lightweight, open-source and configurable control and monitoring system for your room.

At the moment it has a few features such as
* Light control
* Temperature monitoring
* Light level monitoring

My plan is to make Sara easily usable for a variety of internet enabled smart devices such as smart lights, fridges, Google Home, Alexa, etc.
