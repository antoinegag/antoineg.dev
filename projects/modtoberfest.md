# Minecraft meets Hacktoberfest

Modtoberfest is an event I helped organize and run with my friends over at MMD, a Minecraft Mod Development community, Darkhax and Jared.

I got involved trying to come up with a solution to track Pull Requests the same way Hacktoberfest does, but in a simplified way. This turned into a fully fledged web platform that managed and tracked participant progress, provided information about the event and sponsors as well as global statistics.

# Success!

All in all, the event was a striking success for our first run: we got nearly 200 pull requests done to open source minecraft mods!
