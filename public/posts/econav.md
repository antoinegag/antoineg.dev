## Goal

Enable people to **cut their CO2 emissions** as well as **save money** on their fossil fuel powered cars.

## How?

EcoNav runs **analysis on driver habits** from data collected from the cars sensors as well as from a dash cam to give even more precise and useful feedback

_Usage of the dashcam footage to detect **context** about wastes of fuel_

## Current features

EcoNav is still in very early development, so not much has been done yet. I am mostly focusing on researching and trying out different approaches.

I am currently working on computer vision enabling the system to gather contextual info about the world.

## Planned features

#### EcoNav Score

The EcoNav score is a metric to measure the fuel efficiency of the user based
on their driving habits. This score comes as a mark (A+, A, etc.) and is
throughly explained to the user.

#### Real-time analysis

Live readings from the system and how it affects their fuel consumption are
be made available to the user, streaming it to a smartphone attached on the
dash of their car.

#### Trip overview

Each trip is archived and exports are made available via the EcoNav application highlighting user actions that affected their fuel economy and footage
of what happened at the time as well as providing raw data, statistics and
an EcoNav score.

#### Lifetime overview

Exports are also be available from data over the whole lifetime of the application. Enabling users to see changes over time.
