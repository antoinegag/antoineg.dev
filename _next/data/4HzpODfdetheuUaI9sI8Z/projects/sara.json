{"pageProps":{"projectData":{"id":"sara","contentHtml":"<h1>Do it yourself IoT</h1>\n<p>S.A.R.A (formerly known as \"SmartRoom\") is a project of mine I've been revisiting every year or so for the last 3 years.</p>\n<p>It's built using React and NodeJS, running on my local network on a raspberry pi communicating with my devices via the internet or Arduinos.</p>\n<h2>Finding problems to a solution</h2>\n<p>I have several remote enabled and connected devices in my room alone, which is nice as I don't have to reach a switch to turn them off and on but there was amajor problem: the lack of a single unified interface in a single location.</p>\n<p>So I started by turning my lights that had an infrared remote into an internet enabled light, got carried away adding sensors to measure light, temperature and humidity and finally made connectors to my other internet enabled devices. I finally created a web interface, accessible from my laptop, phone or iPad to control and monitor most of what I need to know in my daily life: lights, weather and daily tasks from Trello.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/desk3.jpg\" />\n","name":"S.A.R.A","description":"Smart Assistant and Room Automation","repository":"https://github.com/antoinegag/sara","url":"http://antoineg.dev","tech":["React","NodeJS","Express","C++","Arduino","Raspberry Pi"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
